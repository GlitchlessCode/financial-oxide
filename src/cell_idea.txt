When a cell gets assigned a category, remove it from any previous category, 
then add it to the new category. Each cell should track its category and
its set. Each category should track its sets (and maybe its cell? idk).
Each set should actually be a form of graph or tree of cells, and should 
also track its boundaries.

When a cell is added to a category, check for sets that neighbour or
envelope the new cell, and then if found, check for neighbouring cells
within that set. If there are one or more cells, attach the cell to those
sets, consequently merging sets, as that occurs.

When a cell is removed from a category, split the sets that it is being
removed from.

To determine all of the corners of a set, simply grab every cell in that
set, and iterate over that to find corners.

Use A* to determine disconnections, use closed set to fill new graphs. 
Fill graph from last neighbour via flood fill.
